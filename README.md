This project is a **Fuzzy Logic-based expert system** built in **Python** to recommend animated movies based on user preferences. It utilizes fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and provide recommendations with a certainty factor.

## Features
- **Fuzzy logic inference system**: Uses fuzzy logic instead of traditional rule-based or probabilistic approaches.
- **User-friendly GUI**: Developed with `tkinter` for easy interaction.
- **Fuzzy expert system**: Built using the `fuzzy-expert` Python library.
- **Data processing**: Utilizes `pandas` for handling and processing data.

## Technologies Used
- **fuzzy-expert**: Library for building Mamdani fuzzy inference systems.
